        Dragonfly Martial Arts & Fitness is a premier urban martial arts/mentoring facility. We look to use martial arts as a direct vehicle to build strong and competent leaders. We understand the importance of being model citizens, role models and helping to reinforce the values and principles that parents wish to see in their children. 

Our leadership training gives students the understanding and experience to become a confident and competent leader.  There are those who lead and those who follow. As a part of the leadership and development program curriculum, our students will learn the core qualities of a leader as these qualities are in high demand and can be transported throughout every aspect of one’s life. <br>
    These qualities are as follows:</p></br>
	<p class="bullets">	❖  Effectively communicating your ideas  ❖</br>

		❖  Resolving conflict using win-win techniques  ❖</br>

		❖  The ability to motivate others to attain their best  ❖</br>

		❖  Get students to moving in the same direction  ❖</p></br>


	<p> Dragonfly Martial Arts leadership program will also focus extensively on bullying, predator prevention and life skills such as knowledge, humility, confidence, discipline, respect and empathy.  Students will participate in class discussions to help understand the meaning and importance of how to stand firm against bullying and predator behavior, and how life skills apply at home, at school and in their communities.

    <h2>Lotus Self-Defense</h2>
        <p>Lotus Self-Defense is a mixed martial art developed in Ubon
            Ratchathani, Thailand. The founder, Mr. Precha Mahachanavong was a trained Muay Thai fighter and black belt in Kenpo-Karate This hybrid martial art combines techniques from Muay Thai, Kenpo-Karate, Judo, and Aikido to form one unique self-defense system.
            It's popular today to practice mixed martial arts, but Mr.
            Precha was teaching his system when it was not common. The belief was that what was already good could be made better with the best of other martial arts. His idea developed into a street-effective martial art called Lotus Self-Defense. This system is rare since the only people who introduced it to the United States were, with limited exception, American military service members who were stationed in Thailand during the Vietnam War.
